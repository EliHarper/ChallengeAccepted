#### Description

Have you ever wanted to play a game of ping pong or pool while you're out and about, but couldn't find someone to play? Our objective was to create an application that unites those who share a drive to compete. We help users connect online to propose or accept a challenge, compete, and track the winner of the challenge, along with points gained and skill levels achieved.

#### Application Workflow

When a user visits our website, they begin on our home page, which displays a list of challenges, and a leaderboard of top users. If the user is not logged in, they are able to view any challenge, but unable to accept the challenge. A user may register a new account, or log in to our site using an existing account.

Once a user is logged in, the navigation bar at the top of the site will update to give the user additional functionality. If a user elects to visit their profile page, they will be able to see a current list of pending challenges, and a current list of active challenges, along with their challenge history. Their skill points and levels are also displayed.

A user may also navigate to their inbox, to view messages received from users, or to send a new message to another user. The inbox displays a message from each thread, which a user may click to view the full conversation.

If a user wishes to create a new challenge, they may click on the orange "plus" sign in the navigation bar. This will expand the navigation bar to display a form, which the user may fill out to generate their challenge. Once the challenge is generated, it is pending and will be listed in the Marketplace for other users to accept.
